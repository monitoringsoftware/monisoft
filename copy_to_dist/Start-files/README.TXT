**********************
SAMPLE STARTUP-SCRIPTS
**********************
This folder contains some sample startup scripts for MoniSoft.
Please copy the file of your choice to the folder where the jmonitoring.jar file is located.

You can move the file to any other place if you like, but then you have to edit the "app_path"
variable in the file to point to the correct position of the jmonitoring.jar file.

There are some sample paths in the files to help finding the correct format.

There are startup-files which start MoniSoft with 2Mb, 4MB and default system settings.

If you get a error like the one below please try the default option first:
* Error occurred during initialization of VM
* Could not reserve enough space for object heap
* Error: Could not create the Java virtual machine.
* Error: A fatal exception has occurred. Program will exit.
